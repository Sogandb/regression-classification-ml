# Basic Classification Model (Iris Dataset)

This project demonstrates how I train a simple ML model using Scikit-Learn.

### ✔ Steps:
- Load Iris dataset
- Split data into train/test
- Train a Decision Tree Classifier
- Predict and calculate accuracy

### ✔ Tools Used:
- Python
- Scikit-Learn
- Numpy

This project shows my familiarity with basic ML workflows and model evaluation.
